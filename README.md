# Complex browser example project for UE4 OpenID Client

This is a project that demonstrates:
- logging to facebook or google
- calling the facebook/google API

Uses:
- OpenID Client Plugin, https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/openid-client-plugin/
- VARest, https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/varest-plugin
- JSONBlueprint, https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/json-blueprint

Note: This example requires you to use the plugin bought from the marketplace!

For Facebook use the following user to login (if you're using the default app provided in the example):

    user: open_miywmve_user@tfbnw.net
    password: 1qazXSW@3edc
    
Using the above account won't promt the dialog for "allowing / disallowing the app certain permissions" because they are already allowed. If you wish to properly test this, make your own facebook app and test users as shown in the video tutorial.
